# Assembly_Project-2024-2025
. Project for application on an assembly langauage depending on deep learning for ascii_code table and understanding relation betweem capital and small letters
### Description

This program is written in Assembly language and runs on DOS. It allows users to convert text based on three options:

	1.	Convert text to uppercase (Uppercase).
	2.	Convert text to lowercase (Lowercase).
	3.	Capitalize the first letter of the text (First Letter Capital).

How It Works

	1.	When the program starts, it displays a list of the programmers.
	2.	The user is prompted to press any key to proceed.
	3.	A menu is displayed for the user to choose a text conversion option.
	4.	The user selects one of the available options, or an invalid choice to see an error message.
	5.	The program asks the user to enter a string.
	6.	Based on the chosen option, the program processes the string and displays the converted text.
	7.	The user can repeat the process or exit the program.

Available Options

	•	1 - Uppercase: Converts all lowercase letters to uppercase.
	•	2 - Lowercase: Converts all uppercase letters to lowercase.
	•	3 - First Letter Capital: Capitalizes the first alphabetic character in the string.
	•	4 - Exit: Exits the program.

Output

	•	If the user enters a valid string, the program converts it based on the selected option.
	•	If the user enters an invalid option, the program displays an error message.

Notes

	•	The program supports strings up to 100 characters.
	•	Non-alphabetic characters are ignored during conversion.

Programmers

	•	Mohamed Amin
	•	Mohamed Mekawey
	•	Abdelrahman Hassan

How to Run the Program

	1.	Assemble the code using an assembler like TASM or MASM.
	2.	Link the assembled code using a linker to create an executable file.
	3.	Run the resulting executable file in a DOS environment.
